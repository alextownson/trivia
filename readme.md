[Trivia App](https://alextownson.github.io/trivia/dist/) was made while working through this [React course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=5118s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org). The course outlined requirements for the app and supplied a figma design file. I altered the design and wrote the code myself.
