[Video Game Trivia](https://alextownson.github.io/trivia/dist/) was made while working through this [React course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=5118s&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org). The course outlined the requirements for the quiz but it did not explain how to develop it. I created the start screen illustration and wrote the code myself.
